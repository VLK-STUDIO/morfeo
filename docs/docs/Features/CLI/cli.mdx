:::warning
**@morfeo/cli** it's still in development and will be ready as soon as possible.
:::

If you don't need to generate styles `run time` or you don't want to use `javascript` at all, but you still want to benefit the morfeo eco-system and a centralized theme,
the `morfeo CLI` is what you need!

Morfeo CLI has 2 commands:

- [`build`](./build.mdx) to generate CSS based on your themes;
- [`compose`](./compose.mdx) it creates automatically a theme by composing multiple `.morfeo.ts` files.

You can find a detailed documentation [here for the `build command`](./build.mdx) and [here for the `compose command`](./compose.mdx).

## Specification

The details about all the flags and the configurations of @morfeo/cli can be found in the packages section, [here](../../Packages/cli.mdx).
